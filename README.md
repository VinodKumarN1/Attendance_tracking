Built a functional Student Management System as a self-learning project using PHP and MySQL, following a detailed tutorial. The project includes modules such as student login, attendance tracking, and data management. Through this, I gained practical experience in full-stack development with PHP and learned how to manage session handling, form validation, and CRUD operations.

# Key Features:

User authentication system (Login/Logout)

Attendance tracking for students

Admin dashboard to manage student data

Database operations using MySQL and PHPMyAdmin

# Technologies & Tools:
